/**
 * 
 * In the long term, we'll wish to support a flexible schema'd interchange. 
 * However, in the meantime, I've opted to follow my own advice in the standard. 
 * So: This ENTIRE implementation ONLY supports 8 and 16 byte messages. Endian support requires two datagram types.
 * 
 * Why not support a schema'd interchange now?
 * Let's go through 1 by 1. SBE adds at least an 8 byte header. Flatbuf with Flatcc incurs 16+bytes of overhead.
 * Protobuf varies considerably, as does CapnProto. They're generally the best in this regard in some ways,
 * but even simple decisions like using named fields can cause the size of a message to explode.
 *
 * SBE:
 * Because each datagram gets a unique port:ip combo, we always know what schema is being
 * transmitted to us and by us. Datagram sizes are deterministic. Any datagrams that don't match a known
 * {size, port, ip, frequency} -> schema mapping? They're just rejected.
 * 
 * Including an 8byte header like SBE would either double the size of our message if we did it per clone_type,
 * or significantly increase it if we did it on a packet level. Specifically, about a 10% increase even at 16b messages.  
 * 
 * FlatBuff:
 * Vtables are always constructed, pretty much. You can't escape it.
 * 
 * Protobuf\CapnProto:
 * The Proto Bros don't have much overhead for very short messages, like what we're using... IF you know exactly what you're encoding,
 * and all the tricks. For example, you need to use packed arrays, not fields. Fields add field headers! 
 * 
 * Implementation Notes:
 * The right way to do this is with concepts and constraints, but unfortunately, UE is highly resistant to
 * the use of templated classes in ways that horrify me. These shims will allow us to cleanly add ACTUAL
 * schemas later while getting solid-ish typesafety now. I've provided tag templates as well, to meet
 * the needs of classes that have an existing base class without requiring multiple inheritance,
 * as the diamond pattern is considered undesirable in libraries.
 * 
 * These types may add an RVal copy op. it shouldn't really matter at our scale, but if you're profiling this
 * and looking for perf, that's a candidate. I don't want to make any assumptions about memory management, so I've left it.
 * 
 * Wire Size Note: 
 * Generally the minimum size of an ethernet packet is 64b. This means that pack8 and pack16 don't have much diff
 * in size on the wire, 64b vs 77b but pack8 bristlecone payloads also leave more space for additional per clone-set data. 
 *  
 * Like MTU, minimums aren't specified that I could find, more just settled on? So I can't say what the wifi min is.
